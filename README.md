- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Pawe≈Ç, a computer geek since when I was 8 years old. My adventure started with Commodore C64, than Amiga 500+ with a mod that allowed to switch Kickstart Rom from 1.3 ( native 500+ ) to 2.0 ( Amiga 600 ) and finally the PC computers. 
- üëÄ I‚Äôm a fan of Sci Fi, future technologies and space exploration. 
- üå± Currently I am focused on learning the basics of JS through https://learnjavascript.online/ 28 of 42 chapters.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on any project i could actually contribute to and earn some experience.
-    In order to obtain some real-life experience of solving problems in developer environment and developing proper habits I have started to solve challenges from www.frontendmentor.io.
     -    Each challenge provides the design jpg of the finished project, graphic files required to finish the job and basic html structure with text content.
     -    At the moment the most important conclusion is to plan ahead before starting ANY coding, as that will save the trouble of going back and restructuring the design.
     -    Apart from honing the HTML5, CSS3 and JS skills - FrontendMentor also encourages to use git as often as possible to get used to the version control.
