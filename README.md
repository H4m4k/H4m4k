- 👋 Hi, I’m Paweł, a computer geek since when I was 8 years old. My adventure started with Commodore C64, than Amiga 500+ with a mod that allowed to switch Kickstart Rom from 1.3 ( native 500+ ) to 2.0 ( Amiga 600 ) and finally the PC computers. 
- 👀 I’m a fan of Sci Fi, future technologies and space exploration. 
- 🌱 Currently I am focused on learning the basics of JS through https://learnjavascript.online/ 28 of 42 chapters.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project i could actually contribute to and earn some experience.
-    In order to obtain some real-life experience of solving problems in developer environment and developing proper habits I have started to solve challenges from www.frontendmentor.io.
-    Each challenge provides the design jpg of the finished project, graphic files required to finish the job and basic html structure with text content.
     At the moment the most important conclusion is to plan ahead before starting ANY coding, as that will save the trouble of going back and restructuring the design.
-    To see the challenges I have solved please check https://vercel.com/h4m4k or https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/H4m4k
-    I have created a live website for a friendly company - please check www.regeo.pl
